# Q1: Return me the authors who have papers in PVLDB.

## Method 1:

WITH pid_in_PVLDB AS (
		SELECT pid
		FROM publication
		WHERE jid = (
			SELECT jid
			FROM journal
			WHERE name = 'PVLDB'
		)
	)
SELECT a.name AS author_name
FROM author a
WHERE EXISTS (
	SELECT pid
	FROM pid_in_PVLDB
	WHERE pid IN (
		SELECT b.pid
		FROM writes b
		WHERE b.aid = a.aid
	)
);

## Method 2:

WITH author_flag AS (
		SELECT a.aid, b.name AS author_name
			, CASE 
				WHEN a.pid IN (
						SELECT pid
						FROM publication
						WHERE jid = (
							SELECT jid
							FROM journal
							WHERE name = 'PVLDB'
						)
					)
				THEN 1
				ELSE 0
			END AS author_flag
		FROM writes a
			LEFT JOIN author b ON a.aid = b.aid
	)
SELECT aid, author_name
FROM author_flag
GROUP BY aid, author_name
HAVING sum(author_flag) > 0;
